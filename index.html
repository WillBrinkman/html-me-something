   <h3>A Creature Lost to Time</h3>
   <p>When imagining a mammoth like the one pictured above, a massive hairy beast, one might assume that it walked with the dinosaurs.
        However, mammoths are thought to have gone extinct as little as 4300 years ago.  Many of their bodys remain trapped in the cold permafrost of northern siberia, they remain remarkably preserved thanks to the conditions.
      Aside from scientists who would even care to take advantage of such preserved specimens? Well it turns out there is a new burgeoning market for ethically sourced ivory, thanks to a crackdown on illegally poached elephant ivory.
   This coupled with poor economic conditions within areas of Russia create a situation where people go illegally hunting for these mythic giant carcasses.</p>

      <h3>The Tuskers</h3>

      <p>A common moniker for the people who go out on these expeditions, tuskers risk a lot to hunting for these valuble bones.  While illegal, the fine for getting caught is only $45 but after a few offenses more serious charges can be levied.
         Most tuskers typically start at the beginning on summer and take out a bank loan to pay for the necessary materials.
         <ul>
            <p>These typically include:</p>
            <li>A boat</li>
            <li>A water pump, to blast away at the permafrost revealing whatever bones lie buried beneath</li>
            <li>food &amp; provisions</li>
            <li>Other tools, such as pick axes and shovels</li>
         </ul>
      </p>

   <h3>A Mucky Future</h3>
   <p>Sadly, only around 30% of tuskers end up striking "gold".  Most will have to return home with nothing after spending a whole summer in gruling conditions.
        Still the number of people coming to northern siberia to hunt for these valuble bones is increasing each year.  The ability for mammoth ivory to curve the demand for elephant ivory and alleviate 
      some pressure on their wild numbers is not as cut and dry as it might seem.  There are some entities, such as the state of California, that thinks illegally poached elephant ivory could get passed off as 
   mammoth ivory as a way to avoid the ban.</p>
